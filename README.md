# cse341-backend-w01

## Overview
### Purpose: Develop an API for an existing frontend.

To complete this assignment, you will create a backend for a frontend that is already complete. After building your API endpoints, you will be able to use the frontend to both test it and to see your data in action.

Start by downloading the frontend code.
You will not change any code in it, you will just open the html file in the browser to test that your backend is functional. You'll see a series of ids in the HTML and the JavaScript. Look at the data that the JavaScript file uses to populate the HTML, this includes a lot of text, a few links, and a base64 image.
Create a new node project (npm init) with a server and a REST endpoint to GET all data required by the frontend code you downloaded.
While you're writing your code, test it with a REST Client to ensure it is working correctly.
Once everything looks good in the REST Client, open the frontend webpage in the browser and check to see if it is working (ensure that your backend server is still running on port 8080).
